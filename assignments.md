# Assignments

The course requires handing in two assignments, each counting 50% towards the final mark. Failing to hand in an assignment at the due date, will lead to penalty points. 

Up to 10% extran points can be obtained through activity in the [VisGuides Forum](http://visguides.org) as discussed in the lecture 2.

Assignments will be marked using the Unversity's [Common Marking Scheme 1](https://www.ed.ac.uk/timetabling-examinations/exams/regulations/common-marking-scheme).

## Assignment 1

__Scope:__ Individually (one submission per student, through [Learn](https://www.learn.ed.ac.uk))

__Weight towards course grade:__ 50%

__Due date:__ 15. February 2020

__Expected time investment:__ 15h

__Descripion:__ 
Analyze problems with a set of visualizations and propose improvements.Â 

1. Find __two__ different visualizations (on the internet, in newspapers, TV, etc.). Different means, e.g., a line chart, a node-link diagram.
2. For each visualization, describe __three__ faults and why they are problematic. Make sure to report different faults for each visualiztion, i.e., in total you should report __nine__ faults. 
3. For each visaulization, propose (sketch) __one__ or __two__ visualizations that solve the identified faults. 
4. For each solution you find, argue with a more general visualization guideline.

__Handing in:__ 
* Submit a single PDF with as many pages as you like
* Include any external references (web, papers, slides, etc) in your submission
* You can annotate faults in the visualizations for #2.
* For the sketch in #3, you can use _any_ tool and medium you like: pen and paper, digital pens, illustrator, etc.


__Marking scheme:__

| Task | Max-points |  
| --- | --- | 
| Visualizations found | 4 |
| Faults identified | 24 |
| Fault problem explained | 24 |
| Faults fixed | 24 |
| Fixes explained | 24 |
| __Total:__ | __100__ |



## Assignment 2

__Scope:__ In groups of 3 students (one submission per group, through [Learn](https://www.learn.ed.ac.uk))

__Weight towards course grade:__ 50%

__Due date:__ 4. April 2020

__Expected time investment:__ 15h

__Descripion:__ Students work in groups of 2-3 students to analyze, design, and implement a visualization prototype. This can include interactive web visualizations, data physicalizations, data comics, infographics, etc. 

Part I: Describe your design rationale for the visualization (25%, up to 300 words):
- What is your data and where is it coming from?
- What do you intent to show?
- Why have you chosen this visualization?
- Which alternative designs did you consider?
- Which tool did you use to create it and which drawbacks did you encounter?

Part II: Create an explanatory piece to communicate context, insights, and take-home messages from in this data, using visualizations (75%). This can be
- an infographic (minimum 2 visualizations, around 200 words, 1 A3 page)
- a report (minimum 2 visualizations, around 200 words)
- a data comic (minimum 2 visualizations, minimum 5 panels, 1 A4 page)
