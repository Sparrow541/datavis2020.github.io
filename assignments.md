# Assignments

The course requires handing in two assignments, each counting 50% towards the final mark. Failing to hand in an assignment at the due date, will lead to penalty points. 

Assignments will be marked using the Unversity's [Common Marking Scheme 1](https://www.ed.ac.uk/timetabling-examinations/exams/regulations/common-marking-scheme).

Keep any descriptions as brief as possible. Use bullet lists wherever possible. 

## Assignment 1

This assignment will be introduced and explained in week 3.

__Scope:__ Individually (one submission per student, through [Learn](https://www.learn.ed.ac.uk))

__Weight towards course grade:__ 50%

__Due date:__ 15. February 2020

__Expected time investment:__ 15h

__Descripion:__ 
Analyze problems with a set of visualizations and propose improvements. 

1. Find __two__ different visualizations (on the internet, in newspapers, TV, etc.). Different means, e.g., a line chart, a node-link diagram.
2. For each visualization, describe __three__ faults and why they are problematic. Make sure to report different faults for each visualiztion, i.e., in total you should report __nine__ faults. 
3. For each visaulization, propose (sketch) __one__ or __two__ visualizations that solve the identified faults. 
4. For each solution you find, argue with a more general visualization guideline.

__Handing in:__ 
* Submit a single PDF with as many pages as you like
* Include any external references (web, papers, slides, etc) in your submission
* You can annotate faults in the visualizations for #2.
* For the sketch in #3, you can use _any_ tool and medium you like: pen and paper, digital pens, illustrator, etc.


__Marking scheme:__

| Task | Max-points |  
| --- | --- | 
| Visualizations found | 4 |
| Faults identified | 24 |
| Fault problem explained | 24 |
| Faults fixed | 24 |
| Fixes explained | 24 |
| _Tool critique_ | _??_ |
| __Total:__ | __100__ |



## Assignment 2

__Scope:__ In groups of 3 students (one submission per group, through [Learn](https://www.learn.ed.ac.uk))

__Weight towards course grade:__ 50%

__Due date:__ 4. April 2020

__Expected time investment:__ 15h

__Description:__ Students work in groups of 2-3 students to analyze, design, and implement a visualization prototype. This can include interactive web visualizations, data physicalizations, data comics, infographics, etc. 

__1. Challenge description:__ Describe a challenge around the data. A challenge includes: 
- Data: What is your data and where is it coming from?
- Motivation: What do you intend to see/show with the visualization?
- Audience: who is the indented audience for this visualization and how are thy characterized? 
- Context: what is th context that audience is using your visualization? 

__2. Visualization exploration:__ explore visualization designs for your data 
- explore at least __three different visualization designs__ with at least __two iteration__ for your data (e.g., one design per student in the group)
- explain what does and work, what does not work, and how you went on. 

__3. Final design:__ present a final design. This can be on of the following four formats: 
* Infographic
⋅⋅* at least 3 different visualizations, 
⋅⋅* around 200 words.
⋅⋅* anything between A3 and A0 (poster) format (landscape or portrait) or 
* [Data comic](http://datacomics.net)
⋅⋅* at least 4 A4 pages 
* Interactive visualization 
⋅⋅* __Either__ a single  bespoke and creative interactive visualization, __or__ 
⋅⋅* a set of interactive standart visualizations, i.e., multple-views.
