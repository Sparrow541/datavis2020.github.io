# Data Visualisation 2019/20

<i style="color:#C00">This is the only website where to find learning material about the course. The website will be updated regularly thoughout the course with the latest slides and tutorial information. [Learn](https://www.learn.ed.ac.uk) will be used for assignments only!

## Course content and learning outcomes
The course aims to provide a general understanding of how to use data visualizations in your work and how to be critical about it. The course has three specific learning outcomes which you assignments will be marked against.  

1. __Analysis:__ The ability to identify and describe a visualization challenge in terms of context, stakeholders, data, and tasks.
2. __Design:__ Design and implement a visualization through one of various media (interactive, infographic, data comic) and through a self-chosen set of tools. Visualization designs are meant to match an earlier identified challenge.
3. __Evaluation:__ Critically reflect on a visualization design and suggest constructive solutions to identified challenges. '


The course teaches:
* perceptual foundations, 
* visualization design basics and design steps,
* visualization guidelines,
* a range of visualization techniques (visual representations) and when to use them,
* tools for visualization design and visual data exploration,
* methods to evaluate visualization designs (for evaluation and improvement).

Course assignments will require you to __find a data set you would like to work with during the course__. Students are free to chose the data set they would like to work with, but the __data must be related to climate change or to any of the UN millennium goals__. If you are not sure about the data you chose, talk to me after the lecture. Student work around data on climate change can enter a competition for a possible public exhibition/conference in November, associated to the [COP26 in Glasgow](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-49650909). Data can come from any source as long as privacy and copy rights are respected: the internet, an external collaborator, the student's own research, another course the student is taking, personally collected data. 

## Course Organization

This course has XX lectures, 5 tutorials and 2 assignments. Any lecture is 2h, including 90min lecturing, a 10min break, and 20min for question and answering. Each course week comes with a small home work which should not take more than XX h.

There are 2 assignments, both need to be handed in. There is no written exam. Students will work individually for assignment Assignment 1 and in groups of 3 for Assignment 2.

## Lectures

Lectures are grouped into three sets: __Foundations__ (I-III), __Techniques__ (I-III), and __Advanced__ (I-II), as well as 

### 1. Foundations I: Introduction to Data Visualization
This lecture introduces the basics concepts of data visualizaion: Why are are using data visualization?, why we are not using data visualiztion?, Why does visualization work?, topics such as _perception_ and _color_ and concepts such as _exploratory data analysis_, _data-driven storytelling_, _visual variables_, _visual mappings_, _visualization pipeline_, _visualization techniques_, _visual representation_, and _visualization literacy_.

__Literature__: Sheelag's visual variables

### 2. Foundations II: Visualization design
This lecture talks about effective and ineffective visualization designs. It shows examples of ineffective and deceptive visualizations and describes some _visualization guidelines_ that help designing effective visualiztions. The corresponding tutorial will exercise over common problems with visualizations and work towards proposing solutions via _sketching_, a powerful method introduced in the tutorial.

### 3. Foundations III: Tools for data visualizations
This lecture overviews and introduces common software applications (tools) to help with both: data analysis and the creation of visualizations. We will overview tools for programming environments such as python (e.g., Seaborn) and javascript (e.g., D3), but also tools using common user interfaces (e.g, [Rawgraph](https://rawgraphs.io)], [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de)). The lecture will not teach _how_ to use these tools, but focus on a high-level overview of the many different tools and workflows exist to create data visualizations. 

### 4. Techniques I: Statistical and Multivariate Data

_Techniques_ are fundamental to data visualizations and refer to specific visual representtions (both terms are often used synonymously but 'technique' can include and heavy rely on _user interaction_). Knowing a wide range of techniques, their advantages and disadvantages will help finding appropriate techniques for a given problem as well as improving existing techniques and design novel techinques that solve some current problems. Some of the techniques discussed in Techniques I-III will seem familar, others will be entire unfamilar to you, yet. If a technique looks familar to you, it is worth looking twice, there might be things you did not know about this technique or assumed wrongly.

This first lecture will discuss techniques for statistical and multivariate data (distributions, data with many dimensions/attributes): _boxplots_, _error bars_, _histograms_, _starglyphs_, parallel coordinates plots_, and many more.

### 5. Techniques II: Trees, Networks, and Sets

This lecture covers visualizations techniques for data with relations: trees (hiearchies), networks (graphs), and sets. Techniques include _nodelink diagram_, _adjacency matrix_, _arc diagram_, _pivot graph_, _treemap_, and _up-set_.

### 6. Techniques III: Geographic and Temporal

This lecture covers visualizations techniques for geographical and temporal data. Techniques include _coropleth maps_, _chernoff faces_, _small multiples_, _space-time cubes_, and _animation_ techniques.

### 7. Advanced I: Storytelling and Communication

This lecture focuses on effective presentation techniques when using visualizations in e.g., infographics or presentations. Other presentation media can include videos, posters, and [datacomics](http://datacomics.net). The lecture investigates how presenting and talking with visualizations is different than using visualizations for exploring and analyzing data. Spoiler alert: "It's the audience, stupid!".

### 8. Advanced II: Evaluating visualization techniques
This lecture covers techniques to assess if a given visualization technique (existing or your own creation) is "successful". Successful is a broad term and refers to both effectiveness and efficiency in which a user or audience are supported in their analysis or understanding of the data. The lecture proposes five levels to check for success _Visibility_, _Readability_, _Understandability_, _Appropriateness_, _Truthfulness_. Evaluation methods involve a set of techniques from Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) such as _guidlines_,  _quantitative evaluation_, _qualitative visualization_, _user tracking_, _samples_, and _tasks_, and _statistical analysis_. 

### 9. Guest Lecture: TDB

### 10. Projcect consultation

This lecture slot is reserved to discuss you projects and any open question and topics you may have. During the course, I will keep a [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aIW7J3aJc3nD1q1aBh_ejXzfFTz0TX2NrW-DMJiaLQQ/edit?usp=sharing) to collect suggesions of topics you would like to know more. I will prepare a lecture to talk about some selected topics). Use the document to anonymously suggest topics or pose questions and up-vote those of your fellows.

### 11. Project presentations

In order to give anyone an overview of the many greats works on Assignment 1, this lecture slot asks each group to present their work for about ~3min (depending on numbers of groups). Presentations and presentation quality will not be graded and this is a rather informal event to show and share your work with your fellows. Don't hestiate to offer suggestions for improvement for the final hand-in of [Assignment 2] and how your colleagues have done a specific visualization.
