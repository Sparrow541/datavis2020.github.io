## W1: Critique + Redesign (work-in-progress!)

__Goals:__
* Discover common flaws and mis-interpretations of visualizations
* Create visualization guidelines
* Design improved visualizations

__Material:__ [Charts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-IwXtp2cGhzSne20MI32YTtMOlgiz0nztgKZmuCcZOk/edit?usp=sharing)

__Tasks:__

1. Analysis (10min)
   * _Individually_
   * Look at all the charts provided
   * list as many flaws as you can
2. Discussion (10 min)
   * _With your neighbor_, 
   * discuss the flaws you found 
   * compile a list of common flaws/pitfalls you found. 
   * Give each pitfall 
      * a name (e.g., 'Axes truncated') 
      * and an implication of how this might affect people's (mis)interpretation ('People will mis-interpret differences between values on the y-axis. People might misinterpret actual sizes. Etc.')
   * Discuss faults in class

_break_

3. Re-design (30min)
   * _with your neighbor_
   * pick 2 visualizations from the charts provided
   * for each visualization, sketch 2 possible redesigns
   * Argue with the guidelines (see above) and state where guidlines can be violated.
   
4. Guidelines (20min)
   * _with your neighbor_,
   * formulate visualization guidelines to overcome these flaws/pitfals. Use careful formulations: _"Do X; "Avoid Y"; "If X, then Y"; "Keep in mind that X"_, etc.

5. Show visulizations on wall (20min)


## W2: Challenge + Sketching

[DataVis2020_4-Sketching](slides/DataVis2020_4-Sketching.pdf)

1. Data Challenge: Draft a data challenge for the data you might think working with in assignment #2. A data challenge describes the context for your visualization project. Take a sheet and fold it twice so you get 4 areas. In each area, write notes about the following: 
   1. Data: 
      * What is my data about? 
      * Where does it come from?
      * How is it characterized? 
   2. Messages / Insigths / Facts
      * What am I looking for in the data? 
      * What is the data showing?
      * What do I want to tell to the reader?  
   3. Audience: 
      * Who is my audience? 
      * Why should they matter?
      * What do they know about topic? 
      * What do they know about visualization?
   4. Context
      * Where does the audience engage with the visualization? 
      * How do they engage?
   * Work out the challenge alone, then discuss with your neighbor(s)
   * Are there people with similar data and interest in class? 
2. Sketching intro: This is a quick intro by your tutor to quickly express an idea through sketching
   1. Time a few seconds to draw what your tutor is telling you (~4 pieces)
   2. Draw your home country (10sec)
   3. Draw population density inside (20sec)
3. Sketching data: Sketch your own data or some small data sample provided by your tutor
   * Draw 4 quick sketches (2min each)
   * Discuss with your neighbors
   * Elaborate on 1 visualization 
   * Discuss in class

## W3: Tools and data exploration


## W4: Storyboarding


## T5: Atelier

This tutorial does not have a specific scope. Students are asked to work on their visualizations for Assignment 2. A tutor will be present in each tutorial to discuss progress with students.
