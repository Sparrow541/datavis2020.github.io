## W1: Critique + Redesign (work-in-progress!)

__Goals:__
* Discover common flaws and mis-interpretations of visualizations
* Create visualization guidelines
* Design improved visualizations

__Material:__ [Charts](junkcharts.md)

__Tasks:__

1. Analysis (10min)
   * _Individually_
   * Look at all the charts provided
   * list as many flaws as you can
2. Discussion (20min)
   * _With your neighbor_, 
   * discuss the flaws you found 
   * compile a list of common flaws/pitfalls you found. 
   * Give each pitfall 
      * a name (e.g., 'Axes truncated') 
      * and an implication of how this might affect people's (mis)interpretation ('People will mis-interpret differences between values on the y-axis. People might misinterpret actual sizes. Etc.')
      * and list potential exceptions
   * Discuss in class
3. Guidelines (30min)
   * _In groups of four_,
   * formulate visualization guidelines to overcome these flaws/pitfals. Use careful formulations: _"Do X; "Avoid Y"; "If X, then Y"; "Keep in mind that X"_, etc.

4. __break (10min)__

5. Re-design (30min)
   * _with your neighbor_
   * pick 2 visualizations from the charts provided
   * re-design the visualizations to fix the flaws. 
   * Argue with guidelines and state where guidlines can be violated.
   * Discuss solutions in four.



## W2: Challenge + Sketching




## W3: Tools and data exploration


## W4: Storyboarding


## T5: Atelier

This tutorial does not have a specific scope. Students are asked to work on their visualizations for Assignment 2. A tutor will be present in each tutorial to discuss progress with students.
