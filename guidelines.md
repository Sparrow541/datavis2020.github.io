# Data Visualization Guidelines (selection)



## Design process
* Iterate over your designs, get feedback

## Visualization design
* A chart must be as simple as possible, but not simpler. 
* Rainbow color maps are harmful
* Don’t use piecharts
* Correspondence principle: The same data should produce the same visualization
* Maxime data-ink ratio
* Overview first, zoom and filter, detail on demand (Shneiderman’s Information seeking mantra)
* Use interaction in visualization sparsely and cautionsly
* Don’t use more than six colors together
* Reduce clutter in Parallel coordinates by reordering axes
* Use adjacency matrices for dense networks
* Chose your colors for various types of color-blindness as well as printed in black+white
* Use several complementary visualizations to reduce clutter and complexity
* Avoid overuse of texture
* Highlight and label missing data
* Focus on the patterns in your data

## Communication  & presentation
* Message first, visualization design second.
* Don’t truncate axes
* Label your charts and axes
* Avoid overlapping labels and other occlusions
* Chose meaningful scales
* Add meaningful annotations carefully.
* Lie factor guideline: The representation of numbers, as physically measured on the surface of the graphic itself, should be directly proportional to the quantities represented.
* Don’t use the blow-appart effect
* Introduce and explain your visualization
* Know your audience
* Chose a meaningful chart type
* Avoid redundant information and redundant visual encodings
* Avoid 3D effects and encoding data in 3D volumes
* Careful embellishment can improve memorization if related to the patterns in the data
* Use line charts for continuous (e.g., temporal) values only
* Avoid circular charts
* Rely on simple and well-known visualization unless you have a reason
* Long lines are difficult to follow.
* Take advantage of the space you have available (Alberto Cairo)
* visualizations should not simplify messages, they should clarify them (Alberto Cairo)
* think of stucture firs, eye candy later (Albero cairo) 
* organize your graphic ino layers: summary/intro, information, logical order 
* Experimenting (carefully) with novel foms is not just a whimisical impulse, its a necssity (Albero Cairo)
* the more novel a visalization is,the more redundancy should be included (Albero Cairo)
